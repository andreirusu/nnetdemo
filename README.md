nnetdemo
========

A collection of neural network (non-linear) regression demos implemented in [Torch7](http://www.torch.ch).

Training is performed via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Alternative modes of fitting the input include an evolutionary strategy and radom search of re-initializations with gaussian weigths and biases.
